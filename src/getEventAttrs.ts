/**
 * Generates metadata entries for custom `on:event` and `event:event`
 * attributes used in KEML/extended HTML.
 *
 * Each call creates two {@link IAttributeData} objects:
 *
 * - `on:{name}` — Declares a list of actions to run when the event fires.
 *   * Behaves similarly to standard DOM event attributes but uses **named
 *     actions** instead of JavaScript code.
 *   * Supports multiple actions, declared as space-separated names.
 *   * Integrates with companion filters (`event:{name}`).
 *
 * - `event:{name}` — Defines conditions that must be satisfied for the
 *   corresponding `on:{name}` actions to execute.
 *   * Conditions are expressed as a comma-separated list of key/value pairs.
 *   * Provides fine-grained control, such as hotkey filters or modifier checks.
 *
 * The descriptions are provided in Markdown format and rendered in VS Code’s
 * IntelliSense hover/tooltips.
 *
 * @param name - The base event name (e.g., `"click"`, `"keydown"`, `"reveal"`).
 *
 * @returns An array of two {@link IAttributeData} entries:
 *          one for `on:{name}` and one for `event:{name}`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const attrs = getEventAttrs("click");
 *
 * console.log(attrs[0].name); // "on:click"
 * console.log(attrs[1].name); // "event:click"
 * ```

${

  `* Behaves like the native \`${name}\` event.`
}
* Declares a **list of named actions** to run when the event fires.
  * Actions are **names**, not arbitrary JavaScript code.
  * Names can be **reused** across your KEML project.
* Supports **space-separated action names**.
  * All listed actions run in order when triggered.
* May be gated by a companion **\`event:${name}\` filter** — if conditions don't
  match, no actions fire.

💡 Actions declared here are the **source**; other attributes like \`on\` and
\`reset\` can **reference them**.

Example:
\`\`\`html
<button on:click="save highlight" event:click="ctrlKey">
  Save with Ctrl+Click
</button>
\`\`\`
→ Runs \`save\` and \`highlight\` actions only if **Ctrl** is pressed when
  clicking.`,

  {
    name: `event:${name}`,
    description: {
      kind: MarkupKind.Markdown,
      value: `**Attribute**: \`event:${name}\`

* Defines **conditions** that must be satisfied for \`on:${name}\` actions to
  fire.
* Accepts a **comma-separated list** of \`key=value\` pairs.

Condition rules:
1. \`key=value\` → matches when \`String(event[key]) === String(value)\`
   * Whitespace around \`=\` or the value is ignored
     → \`key=value\`, \`key = value\`, \`key=   value\` are equivalent
2. \`key\` (no \`=\`) → matches when \`!!event[key]\` is truthy
3. \`key=\` (empty value) → matches when \`String(event[key]) === ""\`

* If **all pairs match**, the actions fire.
* If **any pair fails**, the actions are skipped.

💡 Useful for hotkeys and modifiers. Example:
\`event:keydown="ctrlKey, key=a"\`
→ fires only when **Ctrl+A** is pressed.`,
